\section Requirements Requirements
Before installing \feel, you need to get these required packages:
\li g++ (4.7 or higher) OR Clang (3.3 or higher)
\li MPI: openmpi (preferred) or mpich
\li Boost (1.39 or higher)
\li Petsc (2.3.3 or higher)
\li Cmake (2.6 or higher)
\li Gmsh (2.8.3 or higher, can be found at <a href="http://www.geuz.org/gmsh">http://www.geuz.org/gmsh</a>)
\li Libxml2
It is assumed that all these packages are properly installed.

\section Building Building Feel++ from source on *nix
\feel is distributed as a tarball once in a while. The tarballs are available
at <br>
<center>https://github.com/feelpp/feelpp/releases</center>

Download the latest tarball. Then follow the steps and replace
 <tt>x, y, z </tt>with the corresponding numbers

\verbatim
  tar xzf feel-x.y.z.tar.gz
  cd feel-x.y.z
\endverbatim
We define then the current directory as the source one, ie:
\verbatim
  export FeelppSrcDir=`pwd`
\endverbatim

<a href="#" class="top">top</a>

\section Compiling Compiling
Please note that 4 GBytes of RAM is a minimum to compile \feel with <tt><a href="http://www.gnu.org">GCC</a></tt>.
With <a href="http://www.llvm.org/clang">Clang</a>, the memory footprint is much lower.

In order to compile \feel and a test application, we create a new directory:
\verbatim
  mkdir build
  cd build
  export FeelppBuildDir=`pwd`
\endverbatim
<br>
and then, we are able to compile our first application:
\verbatim
  cd $FeelppBuildDir
  $FeelppSrcDir/configure -r
  make -j4
\endverbatim
<br>
This procedure will build the whole library (with Release configuration) and
programs to solve
 \li laplacian problems \f$-\Delta u=1 \mbox{ in } \Omega,\ u=g \mbox{ on } \partial \Omega\f$
 \li a Stokes problem \f$-\Delta \mathbf{u} + \nabla p = 0 \mbox{ in } \Omega,\ \mathbf{u}=\mathbf{0} \mbox{ on } \Gamma_\mathrm{wall}, \mathbf{u}=\mathbf{g} \mbox{ on } \Gamma_\mathrm{inlet}\f$ and free outflow \f$\left(-p \mathbb{I} + \nabla \mathbf{u}\right) \cdot \mathbf{n} = \mathbf{0} \mbox{ on } \Gamma_\mathrm{outlet}\f$
on arbitrary geometries in 2D by default to present \feel's abilities.

\remark
There is a procedure to install as a system library \feel.
\verbatim
  make install
\endverbatim
See page \ref BuildingP for more details.
